Jiyong by Shel Silverstein

Jiyong loves me,
Jiyong cares,
Jiyong picks me peaches and pears.
Jiyong offers me candy and Cokes,
Jiyong listens and laughs at me jokes.
Jiyong helps when I get in a fight,
Jiyong does all my homework at night.
Jiyong misses me,
Jiyong cries,
Jiyong thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Jiyong is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Jiyong just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Jiyong's hand,
In the darkness where Jiyong usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Jiyong's gone!
